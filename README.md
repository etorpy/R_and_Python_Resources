# R and Python Resources

NOTE: the notebook named "Anaconda and R Base experiments" contains instructions for creating an Anaconda environment using R 4.1 with Jupyter Notebooks.
As of March 2023, Anaconda makes working with R 4.0+ very difficult.


Anaconda Navigator 2.3.1 (the GUI for the Anaconda distribution) had an issue with the default channel not having a version of R newer than 3.6.1.  Updating Anaconda Navigator to 2.4.0 and deleting the default channel and adding a new channel for conda-forge fixed the problem and allowed Anaconda to create a new environment using newer versions of both Python and R (R 4.1.3).

**Display conda-forge packages in Anaconda Navigator**

======================  
This repository will start with a notebook titled "R Programming for SPSS Users" and will include basic statistical analysis tasks written in R.  Other important resources will include the links to tutorials and code repositories in this README.md file.  

**Copilot for code generation**  
**NOTE: ChatGPT is useful for generating code as well**
